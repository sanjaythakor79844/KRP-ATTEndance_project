v2.7.0 - TIMESTAMP FIX - Previous Date Persistence Fixed
Build Time: 2026-02-26 7:30 PM
Critical Fix: mongoService.addAttendance() no longer overwrites custom timestamps
Root Cause: timestamp was being overwritten with current time, breaking previous date queries
Solution: timestamp = attendanceData.timestamp || new Date().toISOString()
Status: PRODUCTION READY - PREVIOUS DATE ATTENDANCE WILL NOW PERSIST!
